Robust Techniques: Consider using models that are inherently robust to outliers, such as decision trees, random forests, or quantile regression.
Winsorizing: Instead of outright removal, outliers can be capped at specific percentiles (e.g., 95th and 5th percentiles) to mitigate their influence without discarding them entirely.
Incorporating Outliers: If outliers are informative, try incorporating them into the modeling process through techniques like weighted modeling or outlier-specific features.
